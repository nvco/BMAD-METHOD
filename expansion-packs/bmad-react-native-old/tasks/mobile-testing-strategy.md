# Mobile Testing Strategy

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each testing strategy component must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile testing strategy cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete testing strategy without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Testing Context Requirements

Before beginning strategy development, establish mobile-specific testing context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS, Android, or cross-platform testing approach
- **React Native setup**: Testing framework requirements and configurations
- **Device coverage**: Emulators, simulators, and real device testing needs
- **App store requirements**: Testing for submission compliance and approval
- **Performance constraints**: Battery, memory, and network testing considerations

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile Testing Strategy Format

**When developing each testing component, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present testing component analysis with mobile-specific considerations
2. Provide detailed mobile testing recommendations (platform coverage, tools, automation)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next testing component"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile testing strategy techniques:
     - Cross-platform testing approach validation
     - Mobile device coverage and compatibility planning
     - React Native testing framework integration
     - Performance and battery testing strategy
     - App store submission testing requirements
     - Mobile accessibility testing automation
     - Real device vs simulator testing strategy
     - Mobile CI/CD and automated testing pipeline
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Developing testing components without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next component without user selection.**

## Mobile Testing Strategy Framework

### Phase 1: Mobile Testing Requirements Analysis

1. **Assess mobile application testing needs**:
   - **Functional Testing**: User flows, navigation, feature validation
   - **Cross-Platform Testing**: iOS and Android compatibility and consistency
   - **Performance Testing**: Startup time, memory usage, battery consumption
   - **Device Testing**: Screen sizes, hardware capabilities, OS versions
   - **Network Testing**: Offline functionality, slow connections, data usage
   - **App Store Testing**: Compliance, submission requirements, review preparation

### Phase 2: Mobile Testing Architecture Design (Interactive)

For each testing layer in the mobile testing pyramid:

1. **Present mobile testing layer analysis:**
   - Testing layer purpose and mobile-specific requirements
   - React Native testing tools and framework recommendations
   - Cross-platform coverage and platform-specific considerations
   - Automation potential and CI/CD integration opportunities
   - Resource requirements and team skill development needs

2. **Assess mobile testing implementation approach:**
   - **Unit Testing**: React Native component and logic testing
   - **Integration Testing**: API integration, navigation, and state management
   - **End-to-End Testing**: User journey automation with Detox
   - **Device Testing**: Real device validation and compatibility
   - **Performance Testing**: Mobile-specific performance benchmarking
   - **Accessibility Testing**: VoiceOver and TalkBack automation

3. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** (use 1-9 format above)

4. **Document testing strategy decisions** with mobile-specific rationale

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Testing Coordination

Ensure testing strategy covers cross-platform requirements:

```

### Phase 4: Mobile Testing Implementation Plan

1. **Testing framework setup:**
   - Jest configuration for React Native unit testing
   - React Native Testing Library for component testing
   - Detox setup for iOS and Android E2E automation
   - Real device testing coordination and access

2. **Cross-platform testing strategy:**
   - Shared test scenarios for common functionality
   - Platform-specific test cases for native behaviors
   - Device compatibility testing matrix
   - Performance benchmarking across platforms

3. **CI/CD testing integration:**
   - Automated test execution on code changes
   - Parallel testing for iOS and Android builds
   - Test reporting and quality gates
   - App store submission testing automation
