# Mobile Competitive Analysis

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each competitive analysis dimension must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile competitive analysis cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete competitive analysis without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Competitive Analysis Context Requirements

Before beginning analysis, establish mobile-specific competitive context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or cross-platform analysis
- **Market category**: App store category, subcategory, and competitive landscape
- **Geographic scope**: Regional markets, global competition, platform preferences
- **User segments**: Target demographics, usage patterns, platform distribution
- **Analysis objectives**: Feature gaps, positioning opportunities, market differentiation

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile Competitive Analysis Format

**When analyzing each competitive dimension, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present competitive dimension analysis with mobile-specific insights
2. Provide detailed mobile competitive recommendations (feature gaps, positioning opportunities, market strategies)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next competitive dimension"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile competitive analysis techniques:
     - App store positioning and visibility analysis
     - Feature comparison and gap identification
     - User review sentiment and pain point analysis
     - Mobile UX pattern and design trend evaluation
     - Performance benchmarking and optimization comparison
     - Monetization strategy and pricing model analysis
     - Platform-specific competitive advantage assessment
     - Market share and user acquisition strategy evaluation
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Analyzing competitive dimensions without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next dimension without user selection.**
