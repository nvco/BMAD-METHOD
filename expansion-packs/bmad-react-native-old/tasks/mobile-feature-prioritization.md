# Mobile Feature Prioritization

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each prioritization step must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile feature prioritization cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete prioritization without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Context Understanding

Before beginning prioritization, establish mobile-specific context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS, Android, or cross-platform React Native
- **User acquisition strategy**: App store optimization, marketing channels
- **Technical constraints**: React Native capabilities, native module requirements
- **App store considerations**: Review guidelines, feature restrictions
- **Performance requirements**: Battery usage, memory constraints, startup time

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile Prioritization Format

**When processing each feature, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present feature analysis with mobile-specific considerations
2. Provide detailed mobile impact assessment (user value, technical complexity, platform differences)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next feature"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile prioritization techniques:
     - Mobile user impact scoring (downloads, engagement, retention)
     - Cross-platform development effort estimation
     - App store optimization potential assessment
     - Native vs React Native feasibility analysis
     - Battery and performance impact evaluation
     - Mobile accessibility and compliance requirements
     - iOS vs Android market prioritization
     - Mobile monetization and revenue impact analysis
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Processing features without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next feature without user selection.**

## Mobile Feature Prioritization Framework

### Phase 1: Feature Collection and Mobile Context

1. **Gather feature list** from mobile PRD, user research, or stakeholder input
2. **Establish mobile-specific criteria**:
   - **User Value**: Impact on mobile user engagement and retention
   - **Technical Complexity**: React Native implementation difficulty and platform differences
   - **Platform Strategy**: iOS vs Android prioritization and market considerations
   - **App Store Impact**: Effect on app store discoverability and conversion
   - **Performance Impact**: Battery, memory, and startup time implications
   - **Revenue Potential**: Monetization and user acquisition impact

### Phase 2: Mobile-Specific Analysis (Interactive)

For each feature in the prioritization list:

1. **Present mobile feature analysis:**
   - Feature description and mobile user value proposition
   - Cross-platform implementation considerations
   - iOS and Android market opportunities
   - Technical feasibility with React Native
   - App store optimization potential
   - Performance and user experience impact

2. **Assess mobile-specific factors:**
   - **User Acquisition**: Impact on app store conversion and organic discovery
   - **User Engagement**: Effect on session length, frequency, and retention
   - **Technical Risk**: React Native limitations, native module requirements
   - **Platform Differences**: iOS vs Android implementation variations
   - **Competition**: Competitive advantage and market differentiation
   - **Monetization**: Revenue generation and business model alignment

3. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** (use 1-9 format above)

4. **Document prioritization rationale** with mobile-specific reasoning

### Phase 3: Mobile Prioritization Matrix

Create prioritization matrix using mobile-optimized criteria:

```
MOBILE FEATURE PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

High User Value + Low Technical Complexity = PRIORITY 1 (Quick Wins)
High User Value + High Technical Complexity = PRIORITY 2 (Major Features)
Low User Value + Low Technical Complexity = PRIORITY 3 (Nice to Have)
Low User Value + High Technical Complexity = PRIORITY 4 (Avoid/Future)

MOBILE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- Platform Strategy: iOS first, Android first, or simultaneous
- App Store Timeline: Feature impact on submission and review
- Performance Budget: Memory, battery, and startup time allocation
- Native Dependencies: Features requiring custom native modules
```

### Phase 4: Mobile Implementation Roadmap

1. **Platform strategy decisions:**
   - Single platform launch vs cross-platform development
   - Platform-specific feature variations and optimizations
   - App store submission timeline and coordination

2. **Technical implementation planning:**
   - React Native component architecture and reusability
   - Native module development and platform bridging
   - Performance optimization and testing requirements
   - Cross-platform consistency and platform-specific adaptations

3. **User acquisition and retention alignment:**
   - Features that improve app store conversion
   - Onboarding and user education requirements
   - Analytics and measurement implementation
   - User feedback collection and iteration planning

## Mobile Prioritization Techniques

### 1. Mobile User Impact Scoring
- **Downloads**: Feature impact on app store conversion and downloads
- **Engagement**: Session length, frequency, and user retention improvement
- **Ratings**: Potential for improved app store ratings and reviews
- **Retention**: Long-term user engagement and churn reduction

### 2. Cross-Platform Development Assessment
- **Code Sharing**: Percentage of code reusable between iOS and Android
- **Platform Differences**: UI/UX variations required for platform compliance
- **Native Requirements**: Features requiring platform-specific native modules
- **Testing Complexity**: Cross-platform testing and validation requirements

### 3. App Store Optimization Potential
- **Keyword Opportunity**: Feature impact on app store search discoverability
- **Category Positioning**: Competitive advantage in app store categories
- **Feature Highlights**: Promotional potential for app store listings
- **Review Guidelines**: Compliance with iOS and Android app store policies

### 4. Mobile Technical Feasibility
- **React Native Compatibility**: Framework capabilities and limitations
- **Performance Impact**: Memory, CPU, and battery usage implications
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: External library and service requirements
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Long-term support and update requirements

### 5. Mobile Business Impact
- **Revenue Generation**: Direct and indirect monetization opportunities
- **User Acquisition Cost**: Feature impact on customer acquisition efficiency
- **Market Differentiation**: Competitive advantage and unique value proposition
- **Business Model Alignment**: Fit with overall mobile business strategy
