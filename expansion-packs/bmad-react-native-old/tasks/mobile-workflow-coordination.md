# Mobile Workflow Coordination

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each workflow coordination step must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile workflow coordination cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you coordinate workflows without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Workflow Coordination Context Requirements

Before beginning workflow coordination, establish mobile-specific context:

- **Project type**: Greenfield React Native app, brownfield enhancement, cross-platform migration
- **Team structure**: Mobile developers, designers, QA engineers, product managers
- **Development methodology**: Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid mobile development approach
- **Platform strategy**: iOS-first, Android-first, or simultaneous cross-platform development
- **Release timeline**: App store submission deadlines, beta testing phases, production rollout

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile Workflow Coordination Format

**When coordinating each workflow component, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present workflow coordination analysis with mobile-specific team and process requirements
2. Provide detailed mobile workflow recommendations (agent coordination, task sequencing, deliverable management)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next workflow coordination component"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile workflow coordination techniques:
     - Cross-platform development team coordination and resource allocation
     - Mobile agent task assignment and deliverable handoff management
     - iOS and Android parallel development workflow orchestration
     - App store submission timeline and compliance coordination
     - Mobile testing and QA workflow integration across platforms
     - Performance optimization and monitoring workflow coordination
     - User research and design validation workflow management
     - Mobile release management and deployment coordination
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Coordinating workflow components without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next component without user selection.**

## Mobile Workflow Coordination Framework
