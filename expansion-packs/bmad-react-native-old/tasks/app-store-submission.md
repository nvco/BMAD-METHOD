# App Store Submission

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each submission phase must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - App store submission cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete submission plan without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: App Store Submission Context Requirements

Before beginning submission process, establish platform-specific context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or both
- **App category and metadata**: App store listing optimization requirements
- **Review timeline**: Expected review duration and launch coordination
- **Compliance requirements**: Platform-specific guidelines and restrictions
- **Release strategy**: Staged rollout, beta testing, and production deployment

## CRITICAL: Mandatory App Store Submission Format

**When processing each submission phase, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present submission phase analysis with platform-specific requirements
2. Provide detailed submission recommendations (metadata, compliance, review strategies)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next submission phase"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from app store submission techniques:
     - iOS App Store submission requirements validation
     - Google Play Store submission requirements validation
     - App store listing optimization and ASO strategy
     - Beta testing and TestFlight/Internal Testing setup
     - App review guidelines compliance verification
     - Release timing and rollout strategy coordination
     - App store metadata and promotional asset creation
     - Post-submission monitoring and response planning
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Processing submission phases without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next phase without user selection.**
