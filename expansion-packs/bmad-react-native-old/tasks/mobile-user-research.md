# Mobile User Research

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each research phase must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile user research cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete research plan without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile User Research Context Requirements

Before beginning research, establish mobile-specific context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS, Android, or cross-platform user behavior research
- **Research objectives**: User validation, feature prioritization, usability testing
- **User segments**: Demographics, device usage patterns, app store behavior
- **Market context**: Geographic regions, platform preferences, competitive landscape
- **Research timeline**: Available time, budget constraints, and decision deadlines

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile User Research Format

**When conducting each research activity, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present research activity analysis with mobile-specific methodology
2. Provide detailed mobile research recommendations (user recruitment, testing approaches, data collection)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next research activity"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile user research techniques:
     - Platform-specific user behavior analysis (iOS vs Android)
     - Mobile app store user journey and discovery research
     - Cross-platform usability testing and preference assessment
     - Mobile-first user persona development and validation
     - Touch interaction and mobile UX pattern research
     - App performance and battery usage impact studies
     - Mobile accessibility and inclusive design research
     - In-app analytics and behavioral data analysis
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Conducting research activities without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next activity without user selection.**
