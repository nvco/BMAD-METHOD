# Mobile Knowledge Base Mode Interaction

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each knowledge base interaction must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile KB mode interaction cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you provide knowledge base responses without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Knowledge Base Context Requirements

Before beginning KB mode interaction, establish mobile-specific context:

- **Query domain**: React Native development, iOS/Android platform specifics, cross-platform considerations
- **User expertise level**: Beginner React Native developer, experienced mobile developer, architect-level
- **Implementation context**: Greenfield project, brownfield enhancement, migration scenario
- **Platform focus**: iOS-specific, Android-specific, or cross-platform implementation
- **Technical constraints**: Performance requirements, device limitations, platform compliance

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile KB Mode Interaction Format

**When providing knowledge base information, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present knowledge base topic analysis with mobile-specific considerations
2. Provide detailed mobile development guidance (platform differences, implementation strategies, best practices)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Explore related mobile development topic"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile knowledge base interaction techniques:
     - React Native implementation deep dive with code examples
     - iOS vs Android platform-specific guidance and differences
     - Cross-platform development strategy and architecture patterns
     - Mobile performance optimization and best practices
     - App store submission and compliance requirements
     - Mobile testing and quality assurance approaches
     - Accessibility and inclusive mobile design guidance
     - Mobile security and privacy implementation patterns
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Providing knowledge base responses without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next topic without user selection.**

## Mobile Knowledge Base Technical Examples

### React Native Implementation Patterns
```javascript
// Cross-platform component with platform-specific adaptations
import { Platform, StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';

const PlatformAdaptiveComponent = ({ children, style }) => {
  return (
    <View style={[styles.container, style]}>
      {children}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    // Shared styles
    flex: 1,
    padding: 16,
    
    // Platform-specific adaptations
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        backgroundColor: '#f8f9fa',
        shadowColor: '#000',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.1,
        shadowRadius: 4,
      },
      android: {
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
        elevation: 4,
      },
    }),
  },
});

export default PlatformAdaptiveComponent;
```

### Mobile Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Performance-optimized list component
import React, { memo, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import { FlatList, VirtualizedList } from 'react-native';

const OptimizedMobileList = memo(({ data, renderItem, keyExtractor }) => {
  // Memoized render function to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  const memoizedRenderItem = useCallback(
    ({ item, index }) => renderItem({ item, index }),
    [renderItem]
  );

  // Optimized layout calculation for consistent item heights
  const getItemLayout = useCallback(
    (data, index) => ({
      length: ITEM_HEIGHT,
      offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index,
      index,
    }),
    []
  );

  // Performance configuration for mobile devices
  const listConfig = useMemo(() => ({
    removeClippedSubviews: true,
    maxToRenderPerBatch: 10,
    windowSize: 10,
    initialNumToRender: 10,
    getItemLayout: getItemLayout,
  }), [getItemLayout]);

  return (
    <FlatList
      data={data}
      renderItem={memoizedRenderItem}
      keyExtractor={keyExtractor}
      {...listConfig}
    />
  );
});

export default OptimizedMobileList;
```

### Mobile Accessibility Implementation
```javascript
// Accessible mobile component with cross-platform support
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, Platform } from 'react-native';

const AccessibleButton = ({ 
  title, 
  onPress, 
  disabled = false,
  accessibilityLabel,
  accessibilityHint 
}) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      onPress={onPress}
      disabled={disabled}
      accessible={true}
      accessibilityRole="button"
      accessibilityLabel={accessibilityLabel || title}
      accessibilityHint={accessibilityHint}
      accessibilityState={{ disabled }}
      // Platform-specific accessibility enhancements
      {...Platform.select({
        ios: {
          accessibilityTraits: disabled ? ['button', 'disabled'] : ['button'],
        },
        android: {
          accessibilityComponentType: 'button',
          importantForAccessibility: 'yes',
        },
      })}
      style={[
        styles.button,
        disabled && styles.buttonDisabled
      ]}
    >
      <Text style={[styles.buttonText, disabled && styles.buttonTextDisabled]}>
        {title}
      </Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
