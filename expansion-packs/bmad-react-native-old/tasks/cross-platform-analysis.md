# Cross-Platform Analysis

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each analysis dimension must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Cross-platform analysis cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete analysis without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Cross-Platform Analysis Context Requirements

Before beginning analysis, establish cross-platform context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS, Android, existing native apps, or greenfield React Native
- **Current architecture**: Native apps, hybrid solutions, or web applications to migrate
- **Team expertise**: React Native experience, native development capabilities
- **Business requirements**: Time to market, feature parity, platform-specific needs
- **Technical constraints**: Performance requirements, native module dependencies

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Cross-Platform Analysis Format

**When analyzing each platform dimension, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present platform dimension analysis with cross-platform implications
2. Provide detailed cross-platform recommendations (benefits, tradeoffs, implementation strategies)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next analysis dimension"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from cross-platform analysis techniques:
     - Code sharing potential and reusability assessment
     - Platform-specific feature and UI/UX requirements analysis
     - Performance comparison and optimization strategy evaluation
     - Development team skill and resource requirement analysis
     - Time to market and business value assessment
     - Native module dependency and integration complexity review
     - Maintenance and long-term support strategy evaluation
     - Migration path and implementation roadmap planning
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Analyzing platform dimensions without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next dimension without user selection.**

## Cross-Platform Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Platform Landscape Assessment

1. **Current state analysis**:
   - **Existing Applications**: Native iOS, Android, web, or hybrid solutions
   - **Team Capabilities**: React Native experience, native development skills
   - **Technical Architecture**: Current technology stack and infrastructure
   - **Business Requirements**: Feature priorities, timeline constraints, budget considerations
   - **User Base**: Platform distribution, device preferences, market priorities
   - **Performance Needs**: CPU, memory, battery, and network requirements

### Phase 2: Cross-Platform Feasibility Analysis (Interactive)

For each cross-platform analysis dimension:

1. **Present cross-platform dimension analysis:**
   - Platform-specific requirements and implementation complexity
   - React Native capabilities and limitations for this dimension
   - Code sharing opportunities and platform-specific adaptations needed
   - Performance implications and optimization strategies
   - Development effort and resource requirements

2. **Assess cross-platform strategy options:**
   - **Maximum Code Sharing**: Single codebase with minimal platform differences
   - **Platform-Adaptive**: Shared logic with platform-specific UI and UX
   - **Hybrid Approach**: React Native for most features, native for critical components
   - **Gradual Migration**: Incremental adoption and legacy system integration
   - **Platform-First**: Optimize for one platform, adapt for others

3. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** (use 1-9 format above)

4. **Document analysis findings** with cross-platform recommendations

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Strategy Validation

Ensure strategy addresses all platform considerations:

## Cross-Platform Analysis Tools and Techniques

### React Native Assessment Tools
```javascript
// Platform detection and conditional rendering
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

const PlatformSpecificComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      {Platform.OS === 'ios' ? (
        <IOSSpecificComponent />
      ) : (
        <AndroidSpecificComponent />
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

// Platform-specific styling
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: {
        shadowColor: '#000',
        shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
        shadowOpacity: 0.1,
      },
      android: {
        elevation: 4,
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Performance Analysis Framework
```javascript
// Performance monitoring setup
import { Performance } from 'react-native-performance';

// Cross-platform performance tracking
const trackCrossPlatformPerformance = () => {
  Performance.mark('feature-start');
  
  // Feature implementation
  
  Performance.mark('feature-end');
  Performance.measure('feature-duration', 'feature-start', 'feature-end');
  
  // Platform-specific performance logging
  const metrics = Performance.getEntriesByType('measure');
  console.log(`${Platform.OS} Performance:`, metrics);
};
```

### Cross-Platform Code Sharing Patterns
```javascript
// Shared business logic with platform-specific UI
// shared/api/userService.js
export const UserService = {
  login: async (credentials) => {
    // Shared API logic
  },
  getUserProfile: async (userId) => {
    // Shared data fetching
  }
};

// components/LoginForm.ios.js
export const LoginForm = () => (
  // iOS-specific UI implementation
);

// components/LoginForm.android.js  
export const LoginForm = () => (
  // Android-specific UI implementation
);
```
