# Mobile Story Refinement

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each refinement step must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Mobile story refinement cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete refined story without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Mobile Story Context Requirements

Before beginning refinement, establish mobile-specific context:

- **Target platforms**: iOS, Android, or cross-platform implementation
- **React Native architecture**: State management, navigation, component structure
- **Device considerations**: Screen sizes, performance constraints, offline support
- **App store requirements**: Feature compliance, review guidelines
- **User experience patterns**: Platform-specific UI guidelines and interactions

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Mobile Story Refinement Format

**When refining each story component, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present story component analysis with mobile-specific considerations
2. Provide detailed mobile refinement recommendations (platform differences, technical implementation, user experience)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next story component"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from mobile story refinement techniques:
     - Cross-platform implementation analysis
     - Mobile user experience validation
     - Platform-specific acceptance criteria definition
     - React Native component architecture review
     - Mobile performance requirements validation
     - Device compatibility and testing requirements
     - App store compliance and feature validation
     - Mobile accessibility and internationalization review
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Refining story components without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER proceed to the next component without user selection.**

## Mobile Story Refinement Framework

### Phase 1: Mobile Story Assessment

1. **Review original story** for mobile context and completeness
2. **Identify mobile-specific gaps**:
   - **Platform Coverage**: iOS and Android implementation details
   - **Technical Specification**: React Native component requirements
   - **User Experience**: Touch interactions, navigation, accessibility
   - **Performance**: Memory, battery, and startup time considerations
   - **Testing**: Cross-platform validation and device testing
   - **App Store**: Compliance and submission requirements

### Phase 2: Mobile-Specific Story Refinement (Interactive)

For each story component requiring refinement:

1. **Present mobile story component analysis:**
   - Current story element and mobile applicability
   - Cross-platform implementation considerations
   - Platform-specific variations needed (iOS vs Android)
   - React Native technical requirements and constraints
   - Mobile user experience and accessibility implications

2. **Assess mobile refinement needs:**
   - **User Story Format**: Mobile user context and value proposition
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Platform-specific testing and validation requirements
   - **Technical Requirements**: React Native architecture and component specifications
   - **Performance Criteria**: Mobile-specific performance and optimization targets
   - **Testing Strategy**: Cross-platform testing and device compatibility requirements
   - **Definition of Done**: Mobile quality gates and app store readiness

3. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** (use 1-9 format above)

4. **Document refinement decisions** with mobile-specific rationale

### Phase 3: Cross-Platform Consistency Validation

Ensure story consistency across mobile platforms:

```
MOBILE STORY CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST

✅ User Story includes mobile user context and platform considerations
✅ Acceptance Criteria covers both iOS and Android requirements
✅ Technical Requirements specify React Native implementation details
✅ Performance Criteria include mobile-specific targets
✅ Testing Strategy covers cross-platform validation
✅ Definition of Done includes app store readiness
```

### Phase 4: Mobile Story Enhancement

1. **User story enhancement:**
   - Mobile user personas and usage contexts
   - Platform-specific user value propositions
   - Touch interaction and mobile UX considerations
   - Offline and connectivity scenarios

2. **Acceptance criteria enhancement:**
   - iOS and Android UI/UX compliance
   - Cross-platform functional requirements
   - Mobile performance and accessibility standards
   - Device compatibility and testing coverage

3. **Technical requirements enhancement:**
   - React Native component architecture
   - State management and data flow
   - Native module integrations if needed
   - Platform-specific optimizations

## Mobile Story Refinement Techniques

### 1. Cross-Platform Implementation Analysis
- **Code Sharing**: Identify reusable React Native components

- **State Management**: Data flow and state synchronization
- **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size, memory usage, rendering efficiency
- **Third-Party Integration**: External library and service dependencies

### 5. Mobile Testing Requirements
- **Unit Testing**: Component testing with React Native Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-platform API and navigation testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Detox automation for iOS and Android
- **Device Testing**: Real device validation and compatibility
