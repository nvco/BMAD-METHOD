## Installation

### Local Development Installation ONLY

If you're working with this expansion pack from your own feature branch (e.g., contributing or using unreleased features):

Clone or navigate to the BMad-Method repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
cd bmad-method
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the interactive installer
```bash
npm run install:bmad
```

**Important: Target Directory Paths**

When the installer prompts for your target project directory, you can use:

**Absolute path from BMad-Method repository (recommended):**
```
/Users/your-username/your-projects/your-new-project
```

**Relative path from BMad-Method repository:**
```
../your-new-project    # Goes up one level, then into your project folder
```

The installer will prompt you to select which expansion packs to include, where you can choose extra expansion packs along with the BMad-Method core.

## Recommended Setup: MCP Documentation Server

For the best development experience, the mobile agents can access real-time documentation through the Context7 MCP server. This provides:
- Latest React Native API documentation
- Current iOS SDK references
- TypeScript and library documentation
- Up-to-date best practices and patterns

### Setting up MCP Server

#### Option 1: Cursor IDE
If using Cursor IDE, create `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Claude Code
For Claude Code users:

1. **Create configuration directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   ```

2. **Add MCP configuration**:
   Create `.claude/mcp.json` with:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "context7": {
         "transport": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Or use Claude Code CLI**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
   ```

Once configured, the mobile agents will automatically use the MCP server to:
- Verify API availability and usage
- Check for deprecated patterns
- Access latest documentation
- Ensure compatibility with current versions

**Note**: The expansion pack works without MCP, but having it configured ensures agents provide the most current and accurate guidance.

```

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Screen
```
*mobile-sm create-story "User Authentication Screen"

```

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with planning** - Create PRD and Architecture first
2. **Test on real devices** - Simulators/emulators are good, real devices are better
3. **Profile performance early** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Follow platform guidelines** - Respect iOS HIG and Material Design conventions
5. **Design for offline** - Apps should work without connectivity
6. **Consider both platforms early** - Design for shared components with platform-specific touches

- Xcode 15+
- macOS
- iOS Simulator

**For Android Development:**
