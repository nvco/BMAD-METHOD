# BMad React Native Expansion Pack - Completion Plan

## Current Status ✅

We've completed the **agents phase** and discovered the critical **dependency resolution pattern**:
- ✅ Created 10 mobile agents (analyst, pm, po, architect, dev, ux, sm, qa, master, orchestrator)
- ✅ Updated config.yaml with all agents
- ✅ Updated README.md with complete agent roster
- ✅ Fixed slash prefix naming (`ReactNative` instead of messy path)
- ✅ **KEY DISCOVERY**: Installation system copies `common/` files into each expansion pack automatically

## Missing Infrastructure

Based on analysis of installed structure at `/Users/nver/Projects/test-bmad`, we need to add these folders to complete the expansion pack:

### 1. `tasks/` Folder (Critical Dependencies)
**What our agents reference but we don't have:**
- `create-doc.md` ← Will be copied from `common/` during installation
- `execute-checklist.md` ← Will be copied from `common/` during installation  
- `advanced-elicitation.md` ← Will be copied from `bmad-core/` during installation

**Mobile-specific tasks we need to create:**
- `mobile-feature-prioritization.md` ← Mobile PM agent references this
- `mobile-story-refinement.md` ← Mobile PO agent references this
- `mobile-testing-strategy.md` ← Mobile QA agent references this
- `mobile-performance-optimization.md` ← Mobile Master agent references this
- `app-store-submission.md` ← Multiple agents reference this
- `cross-platform-analysis.md` ← Mobile Master agent references this

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Create `workflows/` folder and mobile workflow files** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ mobile-greenfield-app.yaml - Complete new React Native app development
   - ✅ mobile-brownfield-enhancement.yaml - Existing app enhancement and refactoring  
   - ✅ cross-platform-migration.yaml - Platform migration and React Native adoption
   - ✅ app-store-submission.yaml - iOS App Store and Google Play deployment
   - ✅ mobile-performance-optimization.yaml - Comprehensive performance tuning
   - ✅ mobile-testing-automation.yaml - Cross-platform testing setup and automation

### Phase 2: Mobile Task Files (Critical Dependencies) ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Create missing `tasks/` files** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ mobile-feature-prioritization.md - Interactive mobile feature prioritization workflow
   - ✅ mobile-story-refinement.md - Mobile story refinement with platform considerations
   - ✅ mobile-testing-strategy.md - Comprehensive mobile testing strategy development
   - ✅ mobile-performance-optimization.md - Mobile performance optimization workflow
   - ✅ app-store-submission.md - iOS App Store and Google Play deployment process
   - ✅ cross-platform-analysis.md - Cross-platform implementation analysis and strategy
   - ✅ mobile-user-research.md - Mobile user research methodology and execution
   - ✅ mobile-competitive-analysis.md - Mobile competitive landscape analysis
   - ✅ mobile-analytics-setup.md - Mobile analytics implementation and configuration
   - ✅ mobile-kb-mode-interaction.md - Mobile knowledge base interaction workflow
   - ✅ mobile-workflow-coordination.md - Mobile workflow coordination and agent management

### Phase 3: Document Templates (Medium Priority) ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Create lean mobile templates following core patterns**
   - Follow game expansion pack pattern: adapt core templates, don't over-engineer
   - Use existing core templates where possible (PRD, performance analysis as tasks)
   - ✅ `mobile-brief-tmpl.yaml` ← Adapts core project-brief for mobile (like game-brief)
   - ✅ `mobile-architecture-tmpl.yaml` ← Mobile-specific architecture template
   - ✅ `mobile-story-tmpl.yaml` ← Adapts core story template for mobile development
   - ✅ `app-store-listing-tmpl.yaml` ← Truly mobile-specific template for app stores
   
   **Removed Over-Engineered Templates:**
   - ❌ mobile-prd-template.yaml → Use core `prd-tmpl.yaml` instead
   - ❌ mobile-test-plan-template.yaml → Testing is a task, not a template
   - ❌ mobile-performance-template.yaml → Performance analysis is a task, not template

### Phase 4: Quality & Validation (Medium Priority)
4. **Create missing `checklists/` files**
   - Quality gates for mobile development
   - App store readiness validation

5. **Enhance `data/` folder**
   - Add mobile knowledge base
   - Add mobile-specific guidelines

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
6. **Create `utils/` folder with mobile workflow management**
7. **Test and validate all agent dependencies are satisfied**
8. **Create example/sample projects using the expansion pack**

## Reference Patterns

### Existing Expansion Packs to Study
- `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/`
- `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-2d-unity-game-dev/`

### Installation Pattern Discovery
- Installed structure: `/Users/nver/Projects/test-bmad/.bmad-react-native/`
- Shows how build system populates expansion packs

### Core BMad Resources to Adapt
- `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/tasks/`
- `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/templates/`
- `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/workflows/`

## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Installation system copies `common/` files automatically** - No need to manually copy
2. **Expansion packs should be complete ecosystems** - Include all folder structure
3. **Mobile agents need mobile-specific resources** - Can't just rely on generic core resources
4. **Build system handles dependency resolution** - Reference files normally in agent dependencies
5. **Clean naming with `slashPrefix: ReactNative`** - Shows as `/ReactNative:agents:mobile-dev`

## Next Session Tasks

**Start with Phase 3**: Create missing `templates/` files for document generation. These are essential for our mobile agents to create deliverables.

**Recommended order**:
1. Create `mobile-prd-template.md` (Mobile PM agent dependency)
2. Create `mobile-architecture-template.md` (Mobile Architect agent dependency)
3. Create `mobile-test-plan-template.md` (Mobile Master agent dependency)
4. Continue with remaining templates based on agent priority

## Success Criteria

✅ **Complete expansion pack when**:
- All agent dependency references are satisfied
- Mobile workflows cover complete project lifecycle
- Can build React Native apps from market research to App Store submission
- Installation creates fully functional mobile development environment
- No missing file errors when agents try to load dependencies

**Note**: This plan assumes the current 10-agent structure is correct and focuses on completing the supporting infrastructure to make them fully functional.
