# React Native CLI vs Expo Decision Framework

## Quick Decision Tree

**Answer these questions to determine the best approach:**

### 1. Do you need custom native modules or platform-specific code?
- **Yes** → React Native CLI
- **No** → Continue to question 2

### 2. Do you need immediate access to latest React Native features?
- **Yes** → React Native CLI
- **No** → Continue to question 3

### 3. Is rapid prototyping and easy testing a priority?
- **Yes** → Expo (with ejection path)
- **No** → Continue to question 4

### 4. Will you publish to app stores immediately?
- **Yes, need full control** → React Native CLI
- **No, testing/MVP first** → Expo

## Detailed Comparison

### React Native CLI (Bare React Native)

**✅ Pros:**
- **Full Native Access**: Complete control over iOS/Android projects
- **Custom Native Modules**: Can write Swift/Kotlin code when needed
- **Latest Features**: Access to newest React Native APIs immediately
- **No Constraints**: No platform limitations or restricted APIs
- **App Store Ready**: Direct build and submission process
- **Performance**: No additional overhead from Expo runtime
- **Team Integration**: Better for teams with native iOS/Android developers

**❌ Cons:**
- **Complex Setup**: Requires Xcode, Android Studio, proper environment setup
- **Manual Updates**: Need to handle React Native version upgrades manually
- **Build Complexity**: More complex build process and deployment pipeline
- **Device Testing**: Need physical devices or simulators for testing
- **Platform Knowledge**: Requires some iOS/Android platform knowledge

**👥 Best For:**
- Production apps going to app stores
- Apps needing custom native functionality
- Teams with mobile development experience
- Projects requiring latest React Native features
- Apps with complex platform integrations

### Expo

**✅ Pros:**
- **Easy Setup**: Start coding immediately, no complex environment setup
- **Fast Development**: Hot reload, instant previews on device via Expo Go
- **Managed Updates**: Over-the-air updates without app store submission
- **Built-in Services**: Push notifications, analytics, authentication out of box
- **Testing**: Easy sharing with Expo Go app for testing
- **Cross-platform**: Write once, test everywhere quickly
- **Beginner Friendly**: Great for developers new to mobile development

**❌ Cons:**
- **Limited Native Access**: Cannot add custom native modules easily
- **Bundle Size**: Larger app size due to Expo runtime
- **Update Delays**: May lag behind latest React Native features
- **Ejection Complexity**: Moving to bare React Native later is complex
- **App Store Limitations**: Some restrictions for certain app types
- **Dependency**: Reliant on Expo's ecosystem and decisions

**👥 Best For:**
- MVPs and prototypes
- Developers new to React Native
- Apps with standard requirements (no custom native code)
- Quick testing and iteration
- Cross-platform apps with simple requirements
- Educational projects and learning

## Common Use Cases

### Choose React Native CLI When:

**Enterprise Apps**:
- Need custom security modules
- Require specific hardware integrations
- Must comply with strict security requirements

**Performance-Critical Apps**:
- Gaming applications
- Real-time video/audio processing
- High-performance animations

**Platform-Specific Features**:
- Custom camera functionality
- Deep system integrations
- Hardware-specific features

**Existing Native Apps**:
- Adding React Native to existing iOS/Android apps
- Gradual migration from native code

### Choose Expo When:

**Quick Prototypes**:
- Testing app concepts quickly
- Demo applications for clients
- Hackathons and rapid development

**Standard Business Apps**:
- CRUD applications
- Content display apps
- Simple e-commerce apps

**Learning Projects**:
- First React Native project
- Educational applications
- Proof of concepts

**Cross-Platform Consistency**:
- Apps that need identical behavior on iOS/Android
- Simple utility apps
- Content-focused applications

## Migration Paths

### From Expo to React Native CLI (Ejecting)

**When to Consider:**
- Need custom native modules
- Performance requirements increase
- App store submission complexities
- Team gains native development experience

**Process:**
1. **Expo Eject**: Use `expo eject` command (creates bare React Native project)
2. **Dependency Migration**: Manually handle Expo SDK dependencies
3. **Native Configuration**: Set up iOS/Android build configurations
4. **Testing**: Extensive testing on both platforms
5. **Deployment**: New build and deployment process

**Challenges:**
- One-way process (cannot go back easily)
- Manual dependency management
- Build process complexity increases
- Development workflow changes

### From React Native CLI to Expo (Rare)

**Generally Not Recommended** because:
- Would lose custom native code
- Complex migration process
- Limited scenarios where this makes sense

## Technology Integration

### State Management
**Both Support:**
- Redux, Zustand, Context API
- No significant differences in state management approach

### Navigation
**React Native CLI:**
- React Navigation (recommended)
- React Native Navigation (Wix)
- Full control over navigation behavior

**Expo:**
- React Navigation (recommended)
- Expo Router (file-based routing)
- Some limitations with complex native navigation

### UI Libraries
**Both Support:**
- React Native Paper
- React Native Elements
- NativeBase
- Custom styled components

**Expo Advantage:**
- Many UI libraries have Expo-optimized versions
- Easier setup for some component libraries

## Performance Considerations

### App Size
**React Native CLI:**
- Smaller base bundle size
- Only includes what you need
- Better dead code elimination

**Expo:**
- Larger initial bundle (includes Expo SDK)
- Managed builds can optimize automatically
- Over-the-air updates can help with size management

### Runtime Performance
**React Native CLI:**
- No additional runtime overhead
- Direct access to native performance optimizations
- Better for performance-critical applications

**Expo:**
- Minimal runtime overhead for most apps
- Some performance trade-offs for convenience
- Sufficient for majority of mobile applications

### Development Speed
**React Native CLI:**
- Slower initial setup
- Faster once environment is configured
- More complex debugging process

**Expo:**
- Immediate development start
- Very fast iteration cycles
- Simplified debugging with Expo Dev Tools

## Cost Considerations

### Development Costs
**React Native CLI:**
- Higher initial setup cost (time and expertise)
- Ongoing maintenance complexity
- May require native developers on team

**Expo:**
- Lower initial development costs
- Faster MVP development
- Potentially higher costs if ejection becomes necessary

### Operational Costs
**React Native CLI:**
- Full control over hosting and services
- Choose your own backend services
- Standard app store fees only

**Expo:**
- Expo services costs (builds, updates)
- Potential vendor lock-in considerations
- May require Expo paid plans for production features

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | React Native CLI | Expo |
|----------|------------------|------|
| Development Speed | ⚠️ Slower Setup | ✅ Very Fast |
| Native Access | ✅ Full Control | ❌ Limited |
| Team Experience Required | ⚠️ High | ✅ Low |
| App Store Submission | ✅ Full Control | ⚠️ Some Limits |
| Custom Native Modules | ✅ Yes | ❌ Difficult |
| Testing on Devices | ⚠️ Setup Required | ✅ Expo Go |
| Bundle Size | ✅ Smaller | ❌ Larger |
| Update Flexibility | ✅ Full Control | ✅ OTA Updates |
| Learning Curve | ⚠️ Steep | ✅ Gentle |
| Future Migration | ✅ N/A | ⚠️ One-way Only |

## Recommendations by Team Size

### Solo Developer / Small Team (1-2 people)
**Recommended: Expo**
- Faster development cycles
- Less infrastructure to manage
- Focus on app features, not tooling
- Easy testing and sharing

**Exception**: If you need custom native modules immediately

### Medium Team (3-5 people)
**Recommended: React Native CLI**
- Team can handle complexity
- More control over architecture
- Better long-term scalability
- Professional development practices

**Exception**: If rapid prototyping is priority

### Large Team (6+ people)
**Recommended: React Native CLI**
- Team likely has native expertise
- Need for custom solutions
- Professional deployment pipelines
- Enterprise requirements

## Final Recommendation Algorithm

```
if (needCustomNativeModules || hasNativeDevelopers || isProductionApp) {
  return "React Native CLI";
} else if (isPrototype || isFirstRNProject || needRapidDevelopment) {
  return "Expo";
} else if (teamSize >= 3 && hasDeploymentExperience) {
  return "React Native CLI";
} else {
  return "Expo (with ejection path planned)";
}
```

Remember: This is not a permanent decision for Expo users - you can always eject to bare React Native when requirements change, but plan for this transition early if you anticipate needing it.
