# Session Restart Prompt for BMad React Native Expansion Pack

Copy and paste this entire prompt to continue development:

I'm continuing work on the BMad React Native expansion pack. Here's the current state:

## Current Setup
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-react-native/`
- **Reference Work**: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-react-native-old/` (contains previous work)
- **Current State**: Fresh copy of bmad-core, ready for systematic development

## Key Context
1. **We learned from mistakes**: Previously over-engineered with too many templates and agents
2. **New approach**: Test core components first, only create mobile-specific ones when core is insufficient  
3. **Core insight**: The core `dev.md` agent is generic and can work with mobile-specific data files
4. **Pattern to follow**: Game expansion pack (lean, focused, adapts core rather than reinventing)

## Current Plan
Read the complete systematic plan at: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-react-native/SYSTEMATIC-PLAN.md`

**Current Status**: Ready to start Phase 1 (Foundation Setup)

## Key Principles
- **Test core components first** before creating anything new
- **Stop after each phase** and wait for manual approval
- **Create only when necessary** - if core works, use core
- **Think critically** - question every new component

## Reference Materials
- **BMad Core**: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/` - Base patterns
- **Game Expansion**: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/` - Proven expansion pattern
- **Previous Work**: `/Users/nver/Projects/BMAD-METHOD/expansion-packs/bmad-react-native-old/` - Reference for components we created

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Ignore Old Planning Documents
**DO NOT READ THESE FILES** from bmad-react-native-old/ - they contain outdated over-engineered approaches:
- ❌ `COMPLETION-PLAN.md` - Old plan with too many templates/agents
- ❌ `PLANNING.md` - Earlier outdated planning
- ❌ `README.md` - Documents 10 specific agents we decided not to create
- ❌ `config.yaml` - References agents we decided not to create
- ❌ `agents/` folder - 10 agents we may not need (test core agents first)

**USE SELECTIVELY FOR REFERENCE** (good content to adapt, but be critical):
- ✅ `data/` folder - Well-researched mobile knowledge files (adapt as needed)
- ✅ `tasks/` folder - Some good mobile-specific tasks (only truly mobile-unique ones)
- ✅ `workflows/` folder - Good mobile development workflows (adapt as needed)
- ✅ `checklists/` folder - Quality mobile checklists (only mobile-specific ones)
- ⚠️ `templates/` folder - **MIXED QUALITY**: 
  - ✅ `app-store-listing-template.yaml` - Good, mobile-unique
  - ✅ `mobile-architecture-template.yaml` - Good if core architecture template insufficient
  - ❌ Test templates, story templates - Over-engineered, use core instead

**GOLDEN RULE**: Before using ANY component from old folder, ask "Does core already handle this? Can core + mobile data files do this job?"

## What to Do Next
1. Read the SYSTEMATIC-PLAN.md file to understand the complete approach
2. Start with Phase 1: Foundation Setup
3. Wait for my approval before proceeding to each subsequent phase
4. Always test core component sufficiency before creating new ones

Please confirm you understand the context and are ready to begin Phase 1 according to the systematic plan.
