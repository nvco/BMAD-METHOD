### Step 4: Mobile User Interview Framework

**Mobile-Specific Interview Questions**

1. **Mobile Usage Context Questions**:
   - "Describe your typical mobile app usage throughout the day"
   - "In what situations do you most often use mobile apps like this?"
   - "How does your mobile app usage differ from desktop/web usage?"
   - "What interrupts or distracts you when using mobile apps?"

2. **Platform Preference Questions**:
   - "Do you prefer iOS or Android? Why?"
   - "How do you decide whether to use an app vs mobile web?"
   - "What makes a mobile app feel 'native' to your device?"
