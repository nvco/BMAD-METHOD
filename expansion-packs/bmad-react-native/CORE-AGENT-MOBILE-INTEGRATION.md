# Core Agent + Mobile Data Integration Guide

This document explains how BMad's core agents seamlessly work with mobile-specific data files to provide comprehensive React Native mobile development capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The **core agents + mobile data** pattern provides mobile development capabilities without duplicating core functionality:

```
Core Agents (bmad-core) + Mobile Data Files (expansion) = Mobile Development Capability
```

### Why This Pattern Works

1. **No Duplication**: Core agents handle software development fundamentals
2. **Specialized Knowledge**: Mobile data files provide platform-specific expertise
3. **Seamless Integration**: Agents automatically access expansion data when active
4. **Maintained Consistency**: Core patterns ensure consistent development approach

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Mobile Feature Development

**Scenario**: Implement push notifications

1. **PM Agent** references `mobile-best-practices-2025.md` for user engagement strategies
2. **Architect Agent** uses `ios-guidelines.md` and `android-guidelines.md` for platform notification patterns
3. **Dev Agent** follows `react-native-patterns.md` for implementation and `mobile-troubleshooting.md` for common issues
4. **QA Agent** validates against `mobile-development-checklist.md` for platform compliance

### Example 2: Cross-Platform Analysis

**Scenario**: Evaluate iOS vs Android implementation differences

1. **Architect Agent** analyzes using:
   - `ios-guidelines.md` for iOS-specific requirements
   - `android-guidelines.md` for Android-specific requirements
   - `cross-platform-testing-pitfalls.md` for implementation considerations
2. **Cross-Platform Analysis Task** provides structured evaluation framework

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Automatic Integration Validation
Core agents automatically validate mobile requirements:

1. **Architect Agent** ensures mobile architecture follows platform guidelines
2. **Dev Agent** implements features using mobile best practices
3. **QA Agent** validates against mobile-specific quality gates
4. **PM Agent** creates mobile-appropriate requirements and scope

### Mobile-Specific Quality Gates
Additional mobile validation through:

- `app-store-submission-checklist.md` - Store readiness validation
- Mobile workflows - Structured development and submission processes

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Mobile Context**: Ensure `--ReactNative` flag is used
2. **Generic Solutions**: Core agents may provide generic answers without mobile data access
3. **Platform Conflicts**: iOS and Android requirements may conflict - use cross-platform analysis

### Solutions
1. **Explicit Mobile References**: Mention specific mobile requirements in prompts
2. **Use Mobile Tasks**: Leverage mobile-specific tasks for complex scenarios
3. **Validate Against Checklists**: Use mobile checklists to ensure complete coverage
