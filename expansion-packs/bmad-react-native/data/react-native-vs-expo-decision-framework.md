# React Native vs Expo Decision Framework

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Factor | React Native CLI | Expo Managed | Expo Bare Workflow |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Speed** | 🟡 Moderate | 🟢 Fast | 🟡 Moderate |
| **Native Modules** | 🟢 Full Access | 🔴 Limited | 🟢 Full Access |
| **File Size** | 🟢 Optimized | 🟡 Larger | 🟢 Optimized |
| **Build Control** | 🟢 Full Control | 🔴 Limited | 🟢 Full Control |
| **OTA Updates** | 🟡 Manual | 🟢 Built-in | 🟢 Built-in |
| **CI/CD Setup** | 🟡 Complex | 🟢 Simple | 🟡 Moderate |

## When to Choose React Native CLI

### ✅ Choose CLI When:
- Need custom native modules not available in Expo
- App size optimization is critical
- Need full control over build process
- Integrating with existing native codebases
- Team has native development experience
- Building enterprise apps with specific native requirements

### 📱 Examples:
- Apps requiring custom Bluetooth/NFC integration
- Complex camera functionality
- Custom native UI components
- Deep system integration needs
- White-label apps with custom branding

### 🔧 Setup Requirements:
```bash
# Development environment setup required
- Xcode (iOS development)
- Android Studio (Android development)
- Java Development Kit
- Android SDK
- iOS Simulator/Android Emulator
```

## When to Choose Expo Managed Workflow

### ✅ Choose Expo When:
- Rapid prototyping and MVP development
- Team lacks native development experience
- Standard app requirements (no exotic native features)
- Want OTA updates out of the box
- Building apps for quick market validation
- Educational or learning projects

### 📱 Examples:
- Social media apps
- Basic e-commerce apps
- Content consumption apps
- Simple productivity tools
- Portfolio or showcase apps

### 🚀 Benefits:
```javascript
// Zero native setup required
expo init MyApp
cd MyApp
expo start

// Built-in features
- OTA updates with expo publish
- Easy device testing with Expo Go
- Simplified build process with EAS Build
- Built-in common functionality
```

## When to Choose Expo Bare Workflow

### ✅ Choose Bare When:
- Started with Expo but need native modules
- Want Expo tooling with native flexibility
- Need specific native modules occasionally
- Want best of both worlds
- Planning to eject from managed workflow eventually

### 🔄 Migration Path:
```bash
# Eject from managed workflow
expo eject

# Or start with bare template
expo init --template bare-minimum
```

## Feature Comparison

### Native Module Access
```javascript
// React Native CLI - Full access
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
const { CustomModule } = NativeModules;

// Expo Managed - Limited to Expo SDK
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

// Expo Bare - Full access + Expo modules
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera'; // Best of both
```

### Build Process
```bash
# React Native CLI
npx react-native run-android
npx react-native run-ios

# Expo Managed
expo build:android
expo build:ios

# Expo Bare (with EAS)
eas build --platform android
eas build --platform ios
```

### Bundle Size Comparison
- **React Native CLI**: ~5-15MB (optimized)
- **Expo Managed**: ~20-40MB (includes Expo SDK)
- **Expo Bare**: ~5-20MB (depends on modules used)

## Decision Tree

```
1. Do you need custom native modules?
   ├─ Yes → Do you need them immediately?
   │  ├─ Yes → React Native CLI
   │  └─ No → Expo Bare Workflow
   └─ No → Continue to step 2

2. Is rapid development/prototyping important?
   ├─ Yes → Do you need OTA updates?
   │  ├─ Yes → Expo Managed
   │  └─ No → Consider team experience (step 3)
   └─ No → Continue to step 3

3. Does your team have native development experience?
   ├─ Yes → React Native CLI or Expo Bare
   └─ No → Expo Managed

4. Is app size critical (under 10MB)?
   ├─ Yes → React Native CLI
   └─ No → Any option works
```

## Migration Strategies

### From Expo Managed to Bare
```bash
# Eject from managed workflow
expo eject

# Benefits after ejection:
- Keep existing Expo modules
- Add custom native modules
- Full build control
- Smaller bundle size options
```

### From React Native CLI to Expo
```bash
# Add Expo to existing RN project
npx install-expo-modules@latest

# Gradually adopt Expo modules:
npm install expo-camera
npm install expo-location
```

## Team Skill Assessment

### Frontend-Only Team
**Recommendation**: Expo Managed
- No native development required
- Focus on JavaScript/TypeScript
- Built-in common functionality
- Easy deployment process

### Full-Stack Team with Native Experience
**Recommendation**: React Native CLI
- Full control over implementation
- Optimized for specific needs
- Custom native module development
- Complex integration capabilities

### Mixed Team (Some Native Experience)
**Recommendation**: Expo Bare Workflow
- Balance of simplicity and flexibility
- Learn native development gradually
- Expo tooling for common tasks
- Native code when needed

## Performance Considerations

### Runtime Performance
- **React Native CLI**: Optimal (only what you need)
- **Expo Managed**: Good (some overhead from unused modules)
- **Expo Bare**: Optimal (selective module inclusion)

### Development Performance
- **React Native CLI**: Slower (native setup required)
- **Expo Managed**: Fastest (zero native setup)
- **Expo Bare**: Moderate (some native setup)

### Build Performance
- **React Native CLI**: Fast (local builds)
- **Expo Managed**: Slow (cloud builds)
- **Expo Bare**: Moderate (EAS Build or local)

## Cost Considerations

### Development Costs
- **React Native CLI**: Higher (native expertise required)
- **Expo Managed**: Lower (faster development)
- **Expo Bare**: Moderate (balanced approach)

### Operational Costs
- **React Native CLI**: Lower (no external dependencies)
- **Expo Managed**: Higher (Expo service dependencies)
- **Expo Bare**: Moderate (selective Expo services)

## Future-Proofing

### Technology Evolution
- **React Native CLI**: Always latest, manual updates
- **Expo Managed**: Expo controls update timeline
- **Expo Bare**: Choose your update strategy

### Exit Strategy
- **React Native CLI**: No vendor lock-in
- **Expo Managed**: Can eject to bare workflow
- **Expo Bare**: Minimal vendor dependencies

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "Expo is only for beginners"
**Reality**: Expo is used by many production apps, including large companies

### ❌ "React Native CLI is always faster"
**Reality**: For standard features, Expo managed can be faster to develop

### ❌ "You can't use native modules with Expo"
**Reality**: Expo bare workflow and custom development clients allow native modules

### ❌ "Expo apps are always larger"
**Reality**: With selective bundling and tree shaking, size can be managed

## Real-World Examples

### Expo Managed Success Stories
- Instagram (originally)
- Airbnb (parts of the app)
- Tesla
- Walmart

### React Native CLI Success Stories
- Facebook
- WhatsApp
- Uber Eats
- Discord
