# Mobile Development Quality Gates Checklist

This checklist covers **mobile-specific** quality gates not addressed by core BMad checklists. Use alongside core checklists (story-dod-checklist.md, architect-checklist.md, etc.) for comprehensive mobile development validation.

**Prerequisites**: Complete core BMad checklists first, then use this for mobile-specific validation.
