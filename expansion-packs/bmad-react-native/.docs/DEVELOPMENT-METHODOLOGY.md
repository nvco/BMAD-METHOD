# BMad React Native Expansion Pack - Systematic Development Plan

## Overview

This document provides a complete, systematic plan for developing the BMad React Native expansion pack. It incorporates lessons learned from previous development attempts and follows proven patterns from existing expansion packs.

## Key Principles Learned

### 1. Follow Established Patterns
- **BMad Core**: 12 templates, lean and focused
- **Game Expansion**: 5 templates, adapts core patterns
- **Mobile Expansion**: Should be similar scale, 4-6 templates max

### 2. Don't Over-Engineer
- Use existing core templates where possible (PRD, architecture)
- Only create mobile-specific templates when truly needed
- Tasks are for processes, templates are for documents
- Agents reference templates, breaking references breaks the system

### 3. Build Up, Don't Tear Down
- Start with clean bmad-core foundation
- Add components systematically
- Verify dependencies before any deletions
- Test integration at each step

## Systematic Implementation Plan

**CRITICAL RULE**: Stop after each phase and wait for manual approval before proceeding to next phase.

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Goal**: Establish basic expansion pack structure and configuration

#### Step 1.1: Create Basic Config
- [x] Create `config.yaml` with expansion pack metadata
- [x] Follow game expansion pattern for structure
- [x] Set `slashPrefix: ReactNative` for clean agent naming
- [x] Initially reference core agents only (test if they work with mobile data)

#### Step 1.2: Verify Structure
- [x] Ensure all required folders exist: `tasks/`, `templates/`, `workflows/`, `data/`, `checklists/`
- [x] Test that structure matches BMad expectations
- [x] **Note**: May not need `agents/` folder if core agents work

✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETED** - Foundation setup complete with proper config and folder structure

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 2

### Phase 2: Mobile-Specific Data Files (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Create mobile knowledge that core agents can use

#### Step 2.1: Platform Guidelines
- [x] `ios-guidelines.md` - iOS Human Interface Guidelines summary
- [x] `android-guidelines.md` - Material Design guidelines summary
- [x] `mobile-best-practices-2025.md` - Current mobile development best practices

#### Step 2.2: Technical References
- [x] `react-native-patterns.md` - React Native development patterns
- [x] `performance-monitoring-setup.md` - Mobile performance monitoring
- [x] `cross-platform-testing-pitfalls.md` - Common cross-platform issues

#### Step 2.3: Decision Support
- [x] `react-native-vs-expo-decision-framework.md` - Technology selection guide
- [x] `mobile-troubleshooting.md` - Common mobile development issues

#### Step 2.4: Knowledge Base
- [x] `bmad-kb.md` - Mobile-specific knowledge base integration

#### Step 2.5: Additional Critical Data Files (Added Based on Context7 Analysis)
- [x] `mobile-project-setup-guide.md` - ✅ **CREATED** - Complete greenfield project setup walkthrough (fills Context7 gaps)
- [x] `mobile-development-workflow.md` - ✅ **CREATED** - Day-to-day development workflow and best practices (fills Context7 gaps)

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Tested that core `dev.md` agent can access and use these mobile data files. Context7 analysis revealed gaps in greenfield setup and daily workflow, which have been addressed with comprehensive guides.

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 3

### Phase 3: Essential Templates (Priority: Medium)
**Goal**: Test if core templates work, only create mobile-specific ones if needed

#### Step 3.1: Test Core Templates First
- [x] Test if core `project-brief-tmpl.yaml` works for mobile projects ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Test if core `story-tmpl.yaml` works for mobile stories ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Test if core `prd-tmpl.yaml` works for mobile PRDs ✅ **PASSED**
- [x] Test if core `architecture-tmpl.yaml` works for mobile architecture ✅ **PASSED** (with gaps)

#### Step 3.2: Create Mobile Templates Only If Needed
- [x] `mobile-architecture-tmpl.yaml` - ✅ **CREATED** (core template lacks mobile-specific sections: app stores, platform strategy, mobile performance, code signing)
- [x] `app-store-listing-tmpl.yaml` - ✅ **CREATED** (truly mobile-unique, no core equivalent)

**Key Principle**: Only create if core template is insufficient for mobile needs

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Template loading tested and agent references updated

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 4

### Phase 4: Mobile-Specific Tasks (Priority: High)
**Goal**: Create tasks for truly mobile-specific processes

#### Step 4.1: Mobile-Unique Tasks (No Core Equivalent)
- [x] `app-store-submission.md` - ✅ **CREATED** (iOS App Store and Google Play submission process)
- [x] `cross-platform-analysis.md` - ✅ **CREATED** (React Native iOS/Android implementation analysis)

#### Step 4.2: Mobile-Adapted Tasks (Core Tasks Don't Cover Mobile Specifics)
- [x] `mobile-competitive-analysis.md` - ✅ **CREATED** (Mobile app competitive analysis vs generic competitor analysis)
- [x] `mobile-user-research.md` - ✅ **CREATED** (Mobile user research methodology vs generic user research)
- [x] `mobile-performance-optimization.md` - ✅ **CREATED** (Mobile-specific performance optimization)

#### Step 4.3: Test If These Are Actually Needed
- [x] Test if core `create-next-story.md` works for mobile stories ✅ **PASSED** (domain-agnostic, works perfectly)
- [x] Test if core architecture tasks work for mobile ✅ **PASSED** (no specific architecture tasks exist; handled by architect agent + templates)

**Key Principle**: Only create tasks for processes that are fundamentally different in mobile context

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Core agents can execute mobile tasks; PM agent has access to mobile competitive analysis, user research, and app store submission; Architect agent has access to cross-platform analysis and mobile performance optimization

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 5

### Phase 5: Custom Agents (Priority: Low - Only If Needed)
**Goal**: Create agents only if core agents + mobile data/tasks are insufficient

#### Step 5.1: Test Core Agent Sufficiency First
- [x] Test core `dev.md` + mobile data files for mobile development ✅ **PASSED** - Dev agent has access to all mobile data files, can execute mobile tasks, and implement React Native stories
- [x] Test core `pm.md` + mobile data files for mobile product management ✅ **PASSED** - PM agent can create mobile PRDs, access mobile competitive analysis, app store submission tasks
- [x] Test core `architect.md` + mobile data files for mobile architecture ✅ **PASSED** - Architect agent can use mobile architecture template, access mobile best practices, and design mobile systems

#### Step 5.2: Create Mobile Agents Only If Core Agents Are Insufficient
- [x] `mobile-master.md` - ✅ **NOT CREATED** (Core agents sufficient for mobile orchestration)
- [x] Mobile specialist agents - ✅ **NOT CREATED** (Core agents + mobile data files handle all mobile workflows)

**Key Principle**: Core agents + mobile data/tasks should be sufficient. Only create new agents if absolutely necessary.

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Phase 5 testing confirmed that core agents (dev.md, pm.md, architect.md) are fully sufficient when combined with our comprehensive mobile data files. The addition of `mobile-project-setup-guide.md` and `mobile-development-workflow.md` addresses Context7 gaps, providing complete mobile development coverage without needing custom agents.

**DECISION**: ✅ **SKIP PHASE 5.2** - No custom mobile agents needed. Core agents + mobile data files + Context7 access = Complete mobile development capability.

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 6

### Phase 6: Workflows (Priority: Medium)
**Goal**: Create complete mobile development workflows

#### Step 6.1: Essential Mobile Workflows
- [x] `mobile-greenfield-app.yaml` - ✅ **CREATED** - Comprehensive React Native app development workflow with full production and MVP sequences
- [x] `app-store-submission.yaml` - ✅ **CREATED** - Complete iOS App Store and Google Play Store deployment workflow

#### Step 6.2: Advanced Mobile Workflows (Only If Needed)
- [x] `mobile-brownfield-enhancement.yaml` - ✅ **NOT CREATED** (Existing brownfield-fullstack.yaml covers mobile enhancement needs)
- [x] `cross-platform-migration.yaml` - ✅ **NOT CREATED** (Highly specialized, low usage, would require custom mobile agents)

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Workflow execution tested with core agents. All agent references (pm, dev, architect, qa), task references (mobile-competitive-analysis, mobile-user-research, etc.), and template references (mobile-architecture-tmpl, app-store-listing-tmpl) validated and corrected.

**Key Finding**: Existing brownfield workflows in the expansion pack are generic enough to handle mobile brownfield projects, eliminating the need for mobile-specific brownfield workflows.

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 7

### Phase 7: Quality Checklists (Priority: Low)
**Goal**: Create mobile-specific checklists only if core checklists are insufficient

#### Step 7.1: Test Core Checklists First
- [x] Test if core checklists work for mobile development ✅ **COMPLETED** - Core checklists (architect, pm, story-dod, change, po-master, story-draft) cover general software development practices well
- [x] Identify mobile-specific quality gates not covered by core ✅ **COMPLETED** - Two gaps identified: App store submission process and mobile-specific development quality gates

#### Step 7.2: Create Mobile Checklists Only If Needed
- [x] `app-store-submission-checklist.md` - ✅ **CREATED** - Truly mobile-unique checklist covering iOS App Store and Google Play Store submission requirements
- [x] `mobile-development-checklist.md` - ✅ **CREATED** - Mobile-specific quality gates covering platform compliance, performance standards, mobile testing, and mobile security not covered by core checklists

**Key Finding**: Core checklists handle 90% of quality gates for mobile development. Only two mobile-specific checklists needed to fill genuine gaps in app store submission and platform-specific quality requirements.

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created minimal set of mobile checklists that complement rather than duplicate core BMad quality assurance processes.

**STOP**: Wait for approval before Phase 8

### Phase 8: Documentation (Priority: Low)
**Goal**: Complete expansion pack documentation

#### Step 8.1: Update Core Documentation
- [x] Update `config.yaml` with final configuration ✅ **COMPLETED** - Updated with complete component summary and architecture philosophy
- [x] Update `README.md` to document what's included and how to use ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive documentation covering overview, components, usage, and best practices

#### Step 8.2: Usage Documentation
- [x] Document how core agents + mobile data files work together ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created `CORE-AGENT-MOBILE-INTEGRATION.md` explaining the integration pattern
- [x] Create mobile development workflow examples ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created `MOBILE-WORKFLOW-EXAMPLES.md` with practical usage scenarios
- [x] Document any mobile-specific components created ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created `MOBILE-COMPONENTS-REFERENCE.md` with detailed component documentation

**Key Documentation Created:**
- `README.md` - Complete expansion pack overview and usage guide
- `CORE-AGENT-MOBILE-INTEGRATION.md` - How core agents work with mobile data
- `MOBILE-WORKFLOW-EXAMPLES.md` - Practical workflow examples and scenarios
- `MOBILE-COMPONENTS-REFERENCE.md` - Detailed documentation of all mobile components
- Updated `config.yaml` with final configuration and component summary

**Validation**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Complete documentation suite provides comprehensive guidance for using the mobile expansion pack effectively.

**🎉 EXPANSION PACK COMPLETE!**

## Implementation Rules

### DO:
1. **Test core components first** - Always try core agents/templates/tasks before creating new ones
2. **Stop after each phase** - Wait for manual approval before proceeding
3. **Create only when necessary** - If core works, use core
4. **Start with data files** - Mobile-specific knowledge that core agents can use
5. **Test incrementally** - Validate each component works with core system
6. **Think critically** - Ask "Do we really need this, or does core handle it?"
7. **Track progress in this plan** - Mark completed tasks with [x] and update validation status for session continuity

### DON'T:
1. **Create without testing core first** - Always validate core insufficiency before creating new
2. **Copy game expansion blindly** - Just because game expansion has it doesn't mean we need it
3. **Over-engineer** - Core + mobile data files should handle most needs
4. **Continue without approval** - Stop and wait after each phase
5. **Create mobile versions of everything** - Most core components should work fine
6. **Rush the process** - Test thoroughly at each step

## Validation Checklist

### After Each Phase:
- [ ] All file references resolve correctly
- [ ] No broken agent dependencies
- [ ] Config.yaml lists all agents correctly
