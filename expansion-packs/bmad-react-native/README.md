## Installation

### Method 1: Package.json Installation (Recommended)

Add to your project's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "bmadExpansionPacks": [
    "bmad-react-native"
  ]
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

Copy the expansion pack to your project:
```bash
cp -r expansion-packs/bmad-react-native /path/to/your/project/bmad-react-native
```

## Recommended Setup: MCP Documentation Server

For the best development experience, the mobile agents can access real-time documentation through the Context7 MCP server. This provides:
- Latest React Native API documentation
- Current iOS SDK references
- TypeScript and library documentation
- Up-to-date best practices and patterns

### Setting up MCP Server

#### Option 1: Cursor IDE
If using Cursor IDE, create `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Claude Code
For Claude Code users:

1. **Create configuration directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude
   ```

2. **Add MCP configuration**:
   Create `.claude/mcp.json` with:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "context7": {
         "transport": "http",
         "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Or use Claude Code CLI**:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
   ```

Once configured, the mobile agents will automatically use the MCP server to:
- Verify API availability and usage
- Check for deprecated patterns
- Access latest documentation
- Ensure compatibility with current versions

**Note**: The expansion pack works without MCP, but having it configured ensures agents provide the most current and accurate guidance.

## Enhanced Capabilities

## Usage

### Starting a New React Native Project

1. **Planning Phase (Web UI or IDE)**
   ```
   *analyst → Create project brief
   *pm → Create PRD with mobile requirements
   *mobile-ux → Design platform-appropriate interfaces
   *mobile-architect → Design cross-platform React Native architecture
   ```

2. **Development Phase (IDE)**
   ```
   *mobile-sm → Create implementation stories
   *mobile-dev → Implement features
   *mobile-qa → Test and validate across platforms
   ```

### Working with Designs

The mobile-ux agent can work with:
- Existing mockups and screenshots (provide in `/docs/design/`)
- Figma/Sketch specifications (describe in detail)
- Or create specifications from requirements

### Technology Stack

**Core:**
- React Native (latest stable)
- TypeScript
- React Navigation

**Platform Support:**
- iOS (iPhone and iPad)
- Android (phones and tablets)
- Cross-platform code sharing with platform-specific optimizations

**Flexible (agents will ask):**
- State Management: Context API, Redux, Zustand, or MobX
- UI Libraries: React Native Paper (Material), Elements, or custom
- Testing: Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox

## Project Structure

```

## Common Workflows

### Creating a New Screen
```
*mobile-sm create-story "User Authentication Screen"
*mobile-dev implement
```

### Optimizing Performance
```
*mobile-dev optimize FlatList
*mobile-architect review performance
```

### Preparing for Store Release
```
*mobile-sm release-plan
*mobile-dev prepare-release
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with planning** - Create PRD and Architecture first
2. **Test on real devices** - Simulators/emulators are good, real devices are better
3. **Profile performance early** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Follow platform guidelines** - Respect iOS HIG and Material Design conventions
5. **Design for offline** - Apps should work without connectivity
6. **Consider both platforms early** - Design for shared components with platform-specific touches

## Requirements

**For iOS Development:**
- Node.js 20+
- Xcode 15+
- macOS
- iOS Simulator

**For Android Development:**
- Node.js 20+
- Android Studio
- Android SDK
